### Software and Hardware List
Being a cloud application, Salesforce CRM requires only a good internet connection and a last generation browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or Microsoft Edge for Lightning Experience: only Google Chrome at the time of writing does not have any limitation or special setup needs. Even Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 is supported with some limitations and setup considerations, although it is being discontinued at the end of 2020. Salesforce Classic is supported by the same set of browsers types.

For an up-to-date list of all supported browsers in Lightning Experience or Classic refer to Salesforce Help at https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=getstart_browser_overview.htm&type=5.
